## What is the a versatile variable, volatile variable and auto variable?

* Auto Variable - when a local function is called an auto variable defined within the function is created automatically. However, when the function ends, the variable is destroyed. 
  - Here is an example in code: 
      void test() {
        auto int x = 10;  // 'auto' is optional
        printf("%d", x);  
      }  
  - In this example, x is being called into the stack, but only exists within the function variable (i.e. this is a private variable). Once the last line of the function is complete, variable "x" is deleted from the stack.
